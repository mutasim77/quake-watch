# dbt 📊💡
dbt (data build tool) was used for data transformation in the Data Warehouse (DWH) for further analytics dashboard development.

## Overview
dbt is a powerful tool for transforming data in your data warehouse with the power of SQL and the simplicity of Jinja. With dbt, you can transform your data directly in your warehouse, leveraging the full power of your database's SQL dialect.


## Usage
First, you'll need to set up your dbt Cloud account and connect it to your BigQuery instance. If you don't have an account yet, you can create one [here](https://www.getdbt.com/signup) and follow the [instructions](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/dbt-cloud/cloud-configuring-dbt-cloud/cloud-setting-up-bigquery-oauth) to connect to BigQuery here.

Once you're set up, you can start writing your dbt macros and SQL models to transform your data according to your needs.

## Let's talk about dbt in detail. 🌚
Dbt stands for "data build tool." It's a really handy tool for people who work with data. Imagine you have a big pile of messy data - dbt helps you clean it up and make it useful.

Here's how it works: 🤓

- **Cleaning Data:** First, you need to make sure your data is tidy. Dbt helps you do this by letting you write code to clean and organize your data. It's like tidying up your room before you start playing.
- **Building Models:** Once your data is clean, you can start building models. Models are like templates that help you understand your data better. Dbt lets you create these models easily, so you can see patterns and trends in your data.
- **Testing:** Dbt also helps you make sure your data is accurate. It lets you set up tests to check if your data is behaving the way it should. It's like having a buddy double-check your work to make sure you didn't miss anything.
- **Documenting:** It's important to keep track of what you're doing with your data. Dbt helps you document everything you're doing, so if someone else needs to look at your work later, they can understand what you've done.
- **Collaborating:** Dbt makes it easy for teams to work together on data projects. You can share your code with others, collaborate on building models, and make sure everyone is on the same page.

## Models 🛠️
A data model is an organized design of how the data of entities in a database are related to each other. A dbt model can be thought of as a blueprint of a table or view that represents entities in a database. It is written using SQL and Jinja. Dependencies and transformations are typically written here.

## Macros 🔄
Macros are like shortcuts or reusable pieces of code in dbt. They help you avoid repeating the same code over and over again. For instance, if you often need to calculate average sales per customer, you can create a macro for that calculation. Then, you can use that macro wherever you need to perform that calculation in your models.
