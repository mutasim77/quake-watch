## Project architecture üèóÔ∏è
![Architecture Image](./images/architecture.png)

> I've made a good and clear architecture that makes our work easier to continue once we have it. So basically idea is collecting all the datasets from the different sources and API, after we will do some ETL then store this data in Google Cloud Storage

# Extract, transform, load (ETL): Mage üì• üîÑ üì§
So, our task involves first reading the data, performing some transformations (such as cleaning the data), and then writing this data to our database (which is the interesting part). After that, we will write this data to Google Cloud Storage (GCS). The good part is that we will not manually code and attach. Instead, we will use Mage.
### 1. Setting Up Environments üõ†Ô∏è
   - First, let's configure Mage AI and PostgreSQL using Docker. We'll create a Docker Compose file for seamless setup. Check out ["mage-ai"](/mage-ai) for detailed instructions and Docker files. üê≥

### 2. Extraction üì•
  - Our data extraction process relies on APIs. We've written some Python [scripts](/) to read and export the data from the API. Initially, we're storing the data locally in our ["quakewatch-dataset"](/quakewatch-dataset) folder for easy access and sharing with others. üì¶

### 3. Transformation üîÑ
 - With the data locally available, we move on to transformation. This involves basic tasks like converting timestamps, renaming columns, and fixing any typos in location names. The transformation script files can be found [here](/). üîÑ
  
### 4. Loading üß¨
  - After extraction and transformation, it's time to load the data. We've chosen to load it into two data repositories. The first is our local PostgreSQL database for quick access and analysis. The second is Google Cloud Storage (GCS) for scalability and for accessing it further through [BigQuery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BigQuery).


# Google Cloud ‚òÅÔ∏è 
For cloud services, we're using Google Cloud Platform (GCP), which offers a $300 free trial‚Äîan excellent opportunity for beginners to explore and test cloud services. Having used both GCP and AWS, in my opinion, GCP stands out with its better UI/UX, although AWS is also commendable.

So, what kind of services do we need for this project? Below, I'll provide and write about them in detail.
### 1. Google Cloud Storage üóÑÔ∏è
Cloud Storage is a service for storing objects in Google Cloud. An object is an immutable piece of data consisting of a file of any format. You store objects in containers called buckets, similar to AWS S3 buckets.

I utilize Google Cloud Storage (GCS) to store all my datasets in various formats like CSV, Parquet, etc., enabling easy access from this storage.

### 2. Big Query üìä
Google BigQuery is a serverless, highly scalable data warehouse with a built-in query engine. The query engine can execute SQL queries on terabytes of data in seconds and petabytes in minutes, all without managing any infrastructure or creating/rebuilding indexes.

We load data from GCS into BigQuery, leveraging its powerful querying capabilities. Once data is in BigQuery, we can further analyze it‚Äîdbt can access it, and we can use tools like Looker for visualization.

### 3. Cloud Run ‚òÅÔ∏èüèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Cloud Run is a service where we can run our Docker images. It's simple and easy to use.

In this project, we opted not to have Mage AI running locally. Instead, we created a Docker image of it and then ran it on Cloud Run. Now our Mage AI is hosted on Cloud Run, enabling collaboration and ease of access. All steps were performed using Terraform, making it easy to destroy the setup if needed.

### 4. Compute Engine üíª
Compute Engine provides virtual machines (VMs) on the cloud that we can use for various purposes.

I provisioned an Ubuntu VM and did some configs + also installed Docker, Jupyter, and other necessary tools and software that I'll be using. Currently, I'm running Apache Spark inside this VM for data processing tasks.


# Infrastructure as code : Terraform üîß
Terraform was used to build and manage GCP infrastructure. Terraform configuration files are located in the terraform folder, where you can find detailed information about the files:

- [variables.tf](./terraform/variables.tf): contains variables to make your configuration more reproducible.
- [main.tf](./terraform/main.tf): is a key configuration file consisting of several sections.

### Usage ü™Ñ
To streamline the process, a Makefile with basic configurations has been provided. Here's how to use it:

- Ensure you're in the terraform folder using the bash command `cd terraform`.
- Run `make run` to execute all necessary Terraform commands and apply changes. Simply type `yes` to confirm.
- To remove the stack from the Cloud, use `make kill`.

> With the Makefile, executing Terraform commands becomes as simple as running a single command!

# Transforming data: dbt üß¨
dbt (data build tool) was used for data transformation in the Data Warehouse (DWH) for further analytics dashboard development.

dbt connected with BigQuery, allowing seamless transformation of data within the warehouse. Whenever I needed to perform analytics, I simply took the relevant tables, wrote some models (and macros if necessary), then compiled and built them back, resulting in new and transformed tables inside BigQuery. This process enabled easy visualization and even running of some machine learning models.

Check the dbt [folder](./dbt/) to learn more about dbt and how it works. Personally, I found dbt to be an interesting tool for its versatility and efficiency. Additionally, here's another full repo I have about [dbt-analytics](https://github.com/mutasim77/dbt-analytics) that you can explore for more insights.

# Looker üìäüîç
Looker Studio converts complex data sets into user-friendly reports, enabling the integration of data from multiple sources into one platform.

At the end of our data pipeline, we use Looker to generate reports that summarize and visualize our data effectively. By importing datasets from BigQuery into Looker, we can create dynamic and interactive dashboards that allow for deeper exploration of our data.

For access to the reports generated using Looker, please visit [this link](https://lookerstudio.google.com/u/0/reporting/90f642f4-eb68-4f62-b164-32e038ab65ed/page/82RzD).

# Machine Learning ü§ñüß†
Machine learning is all about making predictions, and QuakeWatch is diving into this exciting field. With the vast amount of earthquake data we've collected, why not use machine learning to predict future seismic events?

The goal is both challenging and intriguing: create a model that can forecast earthquakes. After careful consideration, I decided to use the Random Forest regression algorithm. It's known for its ability to handle complex datasets and produce reliable predictions.

I focused specifically on predicting earthquakes in Central Asia(dataset can be found [here](./quakewatch-dataset/)), an area prone to seismic activity. By training the model on past earthquake data and relevant information, I aimed to gain insights into future earthquakes in the region.

For those interested, you can find the complete code for this ML model [here](./ml-models/)

## Conlusion üéâ
